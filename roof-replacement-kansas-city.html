            <h2>Roof Replacement Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Several factors determine whether replacement is necessary: age of your roof (most asphalt shingles last 20-25 years), extent of damage, frequency of repair needs, and cost-effectiveness. If you're experiencing multiple leaks, extensive shingle damage, or your roof is over 20 years old, replacement is often more economical long-term. Our thorough inspection will help you make the most informed decision for your situation and budget.</p>
