            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How long does a typical residential roof replacement take?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most residential roof replacements in Kansas City take 1-3 days, depending on the size and complexity of your roof, weather conditions, and the materials being installed. We provide a detailed timeline during your consultation and keep you informed throughout the process. Our experienced crew works efficiently while maintaining the highest quality standards to minimize disruption to your daily routine.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What signs indicate I need a new roof versus just repairs?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Several factors determine whether repair or replacement is the best option: age of your roof (most asphalt shingle roofs last 20-25 years), extent of damage, frequency of repairs needed, and cost-effectiveness. If you're experiencing multiple leaks, extensive shingle damage, or your roof is over 20 years old, replacement might be more economical long-term. Our thorough inspection will help you make the most informed decision for your situation and budget.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do you help with insurance claims for storm damage?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely. We have extensive experience working with insurance companies and can guide you through the entire claims process. We'll document the damage thoroughly, meet with your insurance adjuster, and ensure all storm-related damage is properly assessed and covered. Our goal is to maximize your claim while minimizing your out-of-pocket expenses and stress during an already difficult time.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What type of warranty do you provide on your work?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We stand behind our work with comprehensive warranties that cover both materials and workmanship. Manufacturer warranties on materials typically range from 25-50 years, while our workmanship warranty covers installation for multiple years. We'll explain all warranty details during your consultation and provide everything in writing. Our reputation depends on your satisfaction, so we ensure every job meets our high standards.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can you work on my roof during winter months?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, we can perform roofing work during Kansas City winters, though weather conditions may affect scheduling. We prioritize emergency repairs regardless of season to prevent further damage to your home. For non-emergency work, we'll work with you to find the best timing that ensures quality installation while meeting your needs. We monitor weather forecasts closely and will never compromise safety or quality due to rushing through adverse conditions.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We'll provide a detailed preparation checklist, but generally you'll want to remove items from your attic, protect valuable outdoor items, ensure clear access around your home, and inform neighbors about the upcoming work. We handle most of the preparation, including protecting your landscaping and covering outdoor furniture. Our team will walk you through everything needed before we begin, ensuring the process goes smoothly and your property stays protected.</p>
