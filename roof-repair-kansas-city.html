            <h2>Roof Repair Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>Get answers to the most common questions Kansas City homeowners have about roof repairs, helping you understand when and why repairs are needed.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How do I know if my roof needs repairs?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Common signs include water stains on ceilings or walls, missing or damaged shingles, curled or cracked shingles, granules in gutters, daylight visible through roof boards, or sagging roof areas. Even if you don't see obvious problems, it's wise to have professional inspections after severe storms or every few years. Early detection and repair of small problems prevents major damage and expensive repairs later.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How long do roof repairs typically take?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most roof repairs can be completed in a few hours to a full day, depending on the complexity and extent of damage. Simple shingle replacements or flashing repairs are often done the same day. More extensive repairs may require 2-3 days. We provide realistic timelines during our assessment and prioritize emergency repairs that protect your home from immediate damage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Should I repair or replace my roof?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This depends on your roof's age, extent of damage, and cost-effectiveness. Generally, if repair costs exceed 30% of replacement cost, or if you're frequently needing repairs, replacement may be more economical. For roofs under 15 years old with localized damage, repairs are usually the best choice. We provide honest assessments and help you make the most cost-effective decision for your situation.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Will my homeowners insurance cover roof repairs?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Coverage depends on the cause of damage and your specific policy. Storm damage, sudden accidents, and covered perils are typically covered, while gradual wear and maintenance issues usually aren't. We help document damage properly and work with insurance adjusters to ensure covered repairs are approved. We'll also clearly explain what's covered versus what might be your responsibility.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I do roof repairs myself?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While some minor maintenance can be done safely, most roof repairs require professional expertise and equipment for safety and effectiveness. Improper repairs can void warranties, create bigger problems, and pose serious safety risks. Professional repairs ensure proper diagnosis, quality materials, correct installation techniques, and warranty protection. The cost of professional repair is typically much less than fixing DIY mistakes.</p>
