            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How quickly should I call after storm damage occurs?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Call immediately after it's safe to do so. The first 24-48 hours are critical for preventing additional damage from water infiltration. We provide emergency response and temporary protection to minimize further damage while you work through the insurance process. Early intervention can save thousands in additional repairs and prevent structural damage to your home.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Will my insurance cover storm damage repairs?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most homeowners insurance policies cover storm damage from hail, wind, and severe weather, but coverage varies by policy and damage type. We work directly with your insurance company, provide detailed damage documentation, and help ensure all covered damage is included in your claim. Our experience with insurance adjusters helps maximize your coverage and minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How can I tell if my roof has storm damage?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Storm damage isn't always obvious from the ground. Signs include missing or damaged shingles, dented gutters, granules in gutters, water spots inside your home, or visible dents on roof surfaces. We provide thorough professional inspections that identify damage you might miss, including hidden damage that could cause problems later if left unrepaired.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How long does storm damage restoration take?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Timeline depends on damage extent, insurance approval process, and material availability, typically 1-4 weeks for most projects. We begin emergency repairs immediately to protect your home, then complete full restoration once insurance approval is received. We'll provide realistic timelines and keep you informed throughout the process, working efficiently to get your life back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need to get multiple estimates for insurance?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While not always required, multiple estimates can be helpful for insurance claims and your peace of mind. However, the lowest bid isn't always the best choice for storm damage restoration. Focus on contractors with storm damage experience, proper licensing and insurance, and proven track records with insurance claims. Quality restoration prevents future problems and ensures your claim covers all necessary work.</p>

                    <p>Document all damage with photos, cover damaged areas if safely possible, contact your insurance company immediately, and avoid temporary fixes that might affect your claim. We provide emergency tarping and temporary protection while you navigate the insurance process. Avoid contractors who demand payment upfront or encourage you to sign over insurance checks before work is completed.</p>
