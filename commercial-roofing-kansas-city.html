                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Energy-efficient commercial roofing systems like cool roofs and reflective coatings can significantly reduce your utility costs by reflecting heat and reducing cooling loads. Many businesses see 10-30% reductions in energy costs, which adds up to substantial savings over the roof's lifetime. Additionally, some energy-efficient roofing options qualify for tax credits or rebates, and they can improve employee comfort while demonstrating your commitment to environmental responsibility.</p>
